# Prompt for Styling

Master the art of crafting effective prompts for styling your UI components with different visual approaches, themes, colors, and effects. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic color theory to advanced styling techniques.

Well-crafted styling prompts are essential for creating visually appealing, accessible designs that align with your brand identity. This guide helps you create effective styling instructions for optimal results.

## Overview

Creating effective prompts for styling your UI components with different visual approaches, themes, colors, and effects:

### Styling Fundamentals

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy

How elements are prioritized and organized to guide user attention.

**Example:**
> Create a card component with clear visual hierarchy: large title, medium subtitle, small body text, and a prominent call-to-action button using size, color, and spacing to establish importance.

#### 2. Style Type Selection

Choose the overall visual approach that matches your brand and goals.

**Example:**
> Design a dashboard with glassmorphism style using backdrop blur, subtle transparency, and soft shadows to create depth while maintaining a modern, premium feel.

#### 3. Color Psychology

Use colors strategically to influence emotions and behavior.

**Example:**
> Create a financial app interface using blue as the primary color to convey trust and stability, with green for positive values and red for negative values or warnings.

#### 4. Accessibility & Contrast

Ensure designs work for all users with proper contrast and semantic meaning.

**Example:**
> Design a form with WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), clear focus states, and semantic color usage that doesn't rely solely on color to convey information.

### Key Styling Considerations

When crafting styling prompts, be specific about visual hierarchy, color choices, spacing, and interactive states. Don't just say "make it look good" - describe exactly how elements should appear and behave.

### Common Styling Approaches

#### Modern Minimalism

Clean lines, ample white space, and purposeful use of color.

**Example:**
> Create a minimalist login form with clean typography, subtle borders, and a single accent color for the submit button.

#### Rich & Expressive

Bold colors, gradients, and dynamic visual elements.

**Example:**
> Design a creative portfolio hero section with vibrant gradients, bold typography, and animated elements that showcase personality.

## Style Types

Choose a visual style that matches your design goals and brand identity. Each style type has its own characteristics and use cases.

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **flat** | Clean, solid colors without shadows or gradients |
| **outline** | Transparent backgrounds with visible borders |
| **minimalist** | Simple, clean design with subtle elements |
| **glass** | Glassmorphism with backdrop blur effects |
| **ios** | iOS-style with rounded corners and depth |
| **material** | Material Design with elevation and shadows |

### Style Type Guidelines

**Flat Design:** Perfect for modern, clean interfaces. Use when you want minimal distraction and fast loading times.

**Material Design:** Great for Android apps and Google-style interfaces. Provides clear hierarchy through elevation.

**Glassmorphism:** Ideal for premium, modern applications. Creates depth while maintaining transparency.

**Neumorphism:** Best for creative applications where you want a tactile, physical feel.

## Themes

Theme selection affects the overall mood and usability of your interface. Consider your users' preferences, usage context, and accessibility needs.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **light** | Bright backgrounds with dark text |
| **dark** | Dark backgrounds with light text |
| **auto** | Adapts to system preferences |

### Theme Considerations

#### Light Theme
- Better for reading and detailed work
- More familiar to most users
- Better for outdoor/bright environments
- Can appear more trustworthy and professional

#### Dark Theme
- Reduces eye strain in low-light conditions
- Saves battery on OLED screens
- Popular with developers and power users
- Can appear more modern and sophisticated

## Color Theory

Understanding color theory is essential for creating effective and emotionally resonant designs. Colors can influence user behavior, convey brand personality, and improve usability.

### Color Psychology

| Color | Meaning | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Red** | Energy, urgency, passion | Use for CTAs, warnings, and important actions |
| **Blue** | Trust, stability, professionalism | Perfect for corporate and financial apps |
| **Green** | Growth, success, nature | Ideal for success states and eco-friendly brands |
| **Yellow** | Optimism, creativity, attention | Great for highlights and creative tools |
| **Purple** | Luxury, creativity, mystery | Perfect for premium and creative applications |
| **Gray** | Neutrality, sophistication, balance | Essential for text and backgrounds |

### Color Harmony Rules

#### 60-30-10 Rule

Use 60% dominant color, 30% secondary color, and 10% accent color for balanced designs.

- **60%** - Dominant color
- **30%** - Secondary color
- **10%** - Accent color

#### Complementary Colors

Colors opposite on the color wheel create high contrast and visual interest. Use sparingly for maximum impact.

#### Analogous Colors

Colors next to each other on the color wheel create harmony and are pleasing to the eye. Perfect for gradients and subtle variations.

## Colors

Choose colors that align with your brand and create good contrast for accessibility. Consider the emotional impact and cultural associations of your color choices.

## Shadows & Depth

Shadows add depth and hierarchy to your interface. They help users understand which elements are interactive and how content is layered.

| Shadow Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **none** | No shadow effects |
| **small** | Subtle shadow for minimal depth |

| **2xl** | Very dramatic shadow for hero elements |
| **inner** | Inset shadow for pressed/recessed effect |

### Shadow Usage Guidelines

#### Elevation Hierarchy
- **Level 1:** Cards, panels
- **Level 2:** Buttons, inputs
- **Level 3:** Dropdowns, tooltips
- **Level 4:** Modals, overlays

#### Best Practices
- Use consistent shadow directions (usually bottom-right)
- Increase shadow intensity for higher elevation
- Consider light source and environment
- Use colored shadows sparingly for special effects
- Test shadows in both light and dark themes

## Responsive Design

Your styling choices should adapt gracefully across different screen sizes and devices. Consider how colors, shadows, and spacing will work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

| Device | Screen Size | Layout |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **desktop** | 1024px+ | Multi-column |
| **tablet** | 768-1023px | Flexible |
| **mobile** | 0-767px | Single column |

### Responsive Design Guidelines

#### Mobile Considerations
- Touch targets should be at least 44px
- Use larger text sizes for readability
- Simplify navigation and reduce clutter
- Consider thumb-friendly placement
- Optimize for single-column layouts

#### Desktop Enhancements
- Add detailed hover states and animations
- Utilize multi-column layouts effectively
- Include keyboard navigation support
- Provide contextual tooltips and help
- Optimize for mouse and trackpad interactions

### Breakpoint Strategy

- **Mobile (0-640px):** Single column, large touch targets, simplified navigation
- **Tablet (641-1024px):** Two-column layouts, medium touch targets, adaptive navigation
- **Desktop (1025px+):** Multi-column layouts, hover states, detailed interactions

## Accessibility

Accessible design ensures your interface works for users with disabilities. Color contrast, focus states, and semantic meaning are crucial considerations.

### Accessibility Checklist

#### Color & Contrast
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Maintain 3:1 contrast ratio for large text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test with color blindness simulators
