# Elivro Brand Guidelines

This is a strategic visual design proposal intended to break the established visual norms of the personal assistance SaaS market.

---

## Phase 1: Competitor Visual Analysis

### Competitor 1: ai.se

**Visual DNA:** Pastel friendliness. Dominant mint green and light lilac accents on bright white backgrounds. Heavy use of rounded corners on buttons, images, and containers creating a "soft" UI feel.

**Brand Signals:** Safe, approachable, community-oriented. It signals "easy to use" and low stress. Feels like a modern HR platform or a wellness app.

**Imagery:** Mix of idealized, brightly lit stock photography of diverse teams and floating, stylized UI screens inside modern device frames.

### Competitor 2: assistansboken.se

**Visual DNA:** Technical Dark Mode. Near-black backgrounds with high-contrast neon accents (orange, vivid blue, green). A very dense, grid-based layout.

**Brand Signals:** Powerful, data-driven, complex, "pro-tool." It signals deep functionality and control for power users. Feels like a developer tool or IT dashboard.

**Imagery:** Almost exclusively dark-mode UI screenshots showing complex charts, graphs, and dense data tables.

### Competitor 3: primass.se

**Visual DNA:** Corporate Classic. Standard B2B white background with trustworthy corporate blue as the primary color. Standard three-column feature grids and centered headlines.

**Brand Signals:** Established, functional, utilitarian, slightly dated. It signals "safe choice" for traditional businesses.

**Imagery:** Generic business illustrations and standard UI screenshots presented in a very literal way.

---

## Phase 2: Category Pattern Extraction

> "This category currently looks and feels like functional utility software wrapped in standard B2B SaaS templates, oscillating between friendly pastels and technical dark modes, always leading with floating screenshots."

The market is trapped between trying to look overly friendly (to compensate for the difficulty of care work) or overly technical (to prove competence).

---

## Phase 2.5: Explicit Rejection (MANDATORY)

To ensure differentiation, we deliberately reject the following visual conventions found in the competitors. **These are forbidden in our new design.**

### WE DELIBERATELY REJECT:

1. **The "Floating UI Hero"** — We will not place screenshots of our software inside laptop or phone frames in the hero section.

2. **Digital Color Palettes** — No mint greens, lilacs, neon oranges, or standard corporate blues.

3. **Standard Icon Grids** — No three-column layouts with a small icon sitting above a bold headline and body copy.

4. **Rounded Corner Overkill** — We reject the overly soft, bubbly aesthetic of Image 0.

5. **Dark Mode Aggression** — We reject the heavy, black-background dashboard aesthetic of Image 1.

6. **Generic "Smiling Care" Stock Photo** — No staged photos of caregivers pointing at screens with clients.

7. **Geometric Sans-Serif Dominance** — We will not use standard, neutral sans-serif fonts for primary headlines.

---

## Phase 3: Orthogonal Visual Positioning

We need a direction that exists outside the "Soft vs. Hard" and "Light vs. Dark" axis of the competitors.

### The Chosen Direction: "Tactile Humanist" (Artful Care)

The competitors treat care management as a logistical problem to be solved with digital tools. We will position it as a **human endeavor supported by thoughtful craftsmanship**. We will move away from the purely "digital" look and introduce textures, organic forms, and typography that feels editorial and premium rather than software-centric.

- **Brand Archetype:** The Creator + The Caregiver
- **Emotional Promise:** Dignity, artistry, and profound respect for the human element of care
- **What this signals:** We are not just a utility; we are a sophisticated partner that understands the nuance of human relationships in care. We are premium, thoughtful, and enduring.

---

## Phase 4: Visual Inversion Rule

We will apply intentional inversion to the category norms to define our visual toolbox.

| Category Norm | Our Inversion (Tactile Humanist) | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Digital & Flat Colors (Pastels, Neons) | Organic & Pigment Colors (Earthy, rich, muted) | Removes us from the "software" space and grounds the brand in the real, physical world of care. |
| UI-First Imagery (Screenshots dominate) | Editorial-First Imagery (Illustration/Photography led) | Focuses on the outcome and feeling of good care, rather than the mechanics of the tool. |
| Geometric Sans-Serif Fonts | Characterful Serif + Monospace | A high-contrast pairing. The serif adds editorial dignity; the monospace adds technical credibility without being generic. |
| Clean Grids & Containers | Overlapping & Asymmetrical Layouts | Creates a sense of organic flow and complexity, mirroring real human relationships rather than rigid databases. |
| Vector/Digital Shapes | Textured & Natural Forms (Paper, brush strokes) | Adds warmth and tactile humanity to an otherwise sterile digital category. |

## Phase 5: Landing Page Design Concept

### 1. Visual Language System

#### Color Palette (Earthy & Rich)

| Role | Color | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Primary** | Deep Terracotta | Warmth, humanity, grounded |
| **Secondary** | Muted Sage Green | Organic, growth, calm |
| **Background** | Off-white/Cream | Subtle paper texture (rejecting pure screen white) |
| **Text** | Warm Charcoal | Not harsh black |

#### Typography

- **Headline:** A striking, high-contrast serif font with editorial flair (e.g., Canela or Heldane Display). It should feel like a high-end magazine, not a tech site.
- **Body/UI details:** A clean, technical monospace font (e.g., IBM Plex Mono or Space Mono). This provides the necessary technical grounding but in a stylish, architectural way.

#### Imagery Approach

- No UI screens in the initial scroll
- Use abstract, organic line-art illustrations in the brand colors that represent connection, flow, and support
- Photography should be emotive, candid portraits treated with a textured, warm filter, focusing on hands, shared moments, and natural light

---

### 2. Hero Section (The Statement)

**Concept:** The hero must feel like the cover of a premium periodical dedicated to care, not a software sales page.

**Composition:** Asymmetrical editorial layout.

**Visual:** The right half of the screen is dominated by a large, flowing illustration rendered in terracotta and sage brushstrokes, depicting two abstract figures or hands intertwined with flowing lines representing orchestrated care. It feels analog and artistic.

**Headline (Left side):** Set in large, beautiful serif type:
> *The dignity of care, artfully orchestrated.*

**Sub-headline (Monospace):**
> A sophisticated system designed for the human nuance of personal assistance.

**CTA:** A rectangular button, terracotta color, with monospace text. No rounded corners.

**Why this is unmistakable:** It lacks a product screenshot, it uses a serif headline, and the color palette is completely foreign to the competitors' pastels and neons.

---

### 3. Section-by-Section Structure

#### Section A: The Philosophy (Value Proposition)

**Purpose:** To establish our unique viewpoint on care.

**Visual Treatment:** A large, textured background panel in muted sage. Centered serif headline. Below it, three distinct editorial-style vignettes. Instead of icons, use small, abstract organic shapes. The typography dictates the hierarchy, not boxes.

**Differentiation:** Replaces the standard "3-box feature grid" with an editorial narrative flow.

#### Section B: The System (Features revealed artfully)

**Purpose:** To show capability without resorting to generic screenshots.

**Visual Treatment:** "Deconstructed UI." Instead of showing a full laptop screen, we show isolated, stylized components of the interface (e.g., a beautiful calendar view or a scheduling card) floating amidst organic illustrated lines. The UI elements themselves use the new serif/mono font pairing and earthy color system.

**Differentiation:** It suggests the software's power through artistic interpretation rather than literal demonstration.

#### Section C: The Human Element (Social Proof)

**Purpose:** To build trust through shared values.

**Visual Treatment:** Not a logo carousel or grid of headshots. A single, powerful testimonial presented as a "pull quote" from a high-end magazine. Large serif typography for the quote, accompanied by an artistic, candid black and white portrait of the speaker (with a warm duotone treatment).

**Differentiation:** Quality over quantity. It feels curated and respectful, not like a marketing grab.

## Phase 6: Differentiation Validation

### Why this design will still stand out in 12–24 months:

1. **It's Anti-Trend:** By rejecting the current "clean SaaS" and "dark mode" trends entirely, we avoid aging quickly when those trends shift.

2. **It Owns a Feeling, Not a Feature:** Competitors are fighting over who has the best dashboard. We are claiming the territory of "dignity and artistry in care." That is a defensible brand position that transcends UI patterns.

3. **The "Risky" Elements are Strategic:** Hiding the full UI until deeper in the page is risky for standard conversion optimization, but necessary for brand differentiation. It forces the user to engage with our philosophy before assessing our utility. In a market of identical utilities, the philosophy is the differentiator.
